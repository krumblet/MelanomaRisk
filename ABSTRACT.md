Abstract

Introduction: School sun safety policies (SSP) can influence students’ sun safety behaviors
(using hats and sunscreen), but SSP have not been assessed across Texas independent school
districts (ISDs). This study assesses the presence, strength, and intent of SSPs in 102 Texas ISDs
located in counties with the highest and lowest overall relative risk (RR) of melanoma and
explores school-specific factors correlated with SSP.
Methods: Three reviewers qualitatively assessed and coded 11 various SSP data from school
district websites, official documents, social media, media appearances, school official
statements, and the Texas Education Agency’s online database.
Results: Policies for sunscreen use and hats existed in 96% and 94% of ISDs, respectively. In
counties with the highest RR of melanoma, 30% and 44% of ISDs allocated resources for sun
safety and outdoor shade, compared to 2% and 3% in counties with the lowest RR. No ISDs had
SSPs on UV protective clothing, accountability, or modeling sun safety behaviors. SSP strength
positively correlated with percentage of school nurses (ρ = 0.564, p < 0.001), community median
household income (ρ = 0.431, p < 0.001), percentage of female students (ρ = 0.461, p < 0.001),
and tax rate (ρ = 0.366, p = 0.0002). Negative correlations were found with percentage of central
staff administration (ρ = -0.523, p < 0.001) and graduation rates (ρ = -0.335, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that ISD in counties with the highest RR of melanoma are
more likely to have SSP than school districts with lower melanoma RR. underscore the need for
interventions to strengthen SSPs, especially in areas with the lowest melanoma risk.
